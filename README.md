## Notes

I really didn't know how I was going to make two unique charts with the data that was made available by the Spotify API, so I just decided to focus on the followers as it was the only value from the response that had any significance. I also had trouble with rendering the charts. I tried using recharts but it didn't work. After asking GitHub Copilot, I concluded that the problem may be Microsoft Defender flagging the library as malware so I had to use another library. I used chart.js which has a bit of a learning curve but I got it in the end with the help of Copilot.
